This year in Calculus BC We Worked On Limits, Continuity, Reimann Sums, Definite, And Indefinite Integrals. We Have Completed Three Different Summative Tests And A Group Project In Class, Studying The Formation Of Reimann Sums And Integration.

The jump from Calculus BC and Precalculus is significant, and Aaron has had some difficulties adapting to this new environment. Aaron has been struggling in class this semester, and currently has a D+ so far, achieving a 65% on the Final exam. Aaron struggles with proofs, and I recommend that Aaron meet with teacher more. These are important skills and will help Aaron improve on some of their weaker areas. Aaron always completes homework. For instance, Aaron hasn't had a late assignment all year!

In short Aaron struggled in Calculus BC this semester. They have not always performed in class, but I hope to see improvement next semester.
