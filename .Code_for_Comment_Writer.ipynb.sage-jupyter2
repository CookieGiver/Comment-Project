Aaron has been struggling in class this semester, and currently has a D+ so far, achieving a 65% on the Final exam. Aaron struggles with proofs, and I recommend that Aaron meet with teacher more. These are important skills and will help Aaron improve on some of their weaker areas. Aaron always completes homework. For instance, Aaron hasn't had a late assignment all year!\n\nIn short Aaron struggled in Calculus BC this semester.
